Initialization: The game initializes with an array of button colors (buttonColours), empty arrays for gamePattern (Simon's sequence) and userClickedPattern (user's input), and variables to track the game's state (started, level).

Starting the Game: When the user presses any key ($(document).keypress()), if the game hasn't started (!started), it begins by displaying "Level 0" and calling nextSequence() to generate the first color pattern.

User Interaction: When the user clicks a button (.btn), it adds the clicked color to userClickedPattern, plays a sound associated with that color, and animates the button press.

Checking the User's Answer: After each user click, checkAnswer() compares the current user input (userClickedPattern) with the game pattern (gamePattern). If they match up to the current level, it proceeds to the next level by calling nextSequence(). If there's a mistake, it plays a "wrong" sound, displays "Game Over," and resets the game with startOver().

Generating the Next Sequence: nextSequence() increments the level, displays the current level, generates a random color from buttonColours, adds it to gamePattern, displays a brief animation for that color, and plays its associated sound.

Animation and Sound: animatePress() adds a visual "pressed" effect to a button, and playSound() plays the corresponding sound file for a given color.

Restarting the Game: startOver() resets the game by setting level to 0, clearing gamePattern and userClickedPattern, and resetting the started variable to false.
